With the module [pygame.draw](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html) shapes like rectangles, circles, polygons or liens can be drawn.

[`pygame.draw.rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.rect) draws filled rectangular shapes or outlines. The arguments are the target _Surface_ (i.s. the display), the _color_, the _rectangle_ and the optional outline _width_. The _rectangle_ argument is a tuple with the 4 components (_x_, _y_, _width_, _height_), where (_x_, _y_) is the upper left point of the rectangle. Alternatively, the argument can be a [`pygame.Rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) object:

```py
pygame.draw.rect(window, color, (x, y, width, height))
```

```py
rectangle = pygame.Rect(x, y, width, height)
pygame.draw.rect(window, color, rectangle)
```

[`pygame.draw.circle`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.circle) draws filled circles or outlines. The arguments are the target _Surface_ (i.s. the display), the _color_, the _center_, the _radius_ and the optional outline _width_. The _center_ argument is a tuple with the 2 components (_x_, _y_):

```py
pygame.draw.circle(window, color, (x, y), radius)
```

[`pygame.draw.polygon`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.polygon) draws filled polygons or contours. The arguments are the target _Surface_ (i.s. the display), the _color_, a list of _points_ and the optional contour _width_. Each _point_ is a tuple with the 2 components (_x_, _y_):

```cpp
pygame.draw.polygon(window, color, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)])
```

Unfortunately there is no good way to draw a transparent shape. See [pygame.draw](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html) module:

> A color's alpha value will be written directly into the surface [...], but the draw function will not draw transparently.

Therefor you hve to do a workaround:

1. Create a [`pygame.Surface`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html) object with a per-pixel alpha format large enough to cover the shape.
2. Draw the shape on the _Surface.
3. Blend the _Surface_ with the target _Surface_. [`blit()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.blit) by default blends 2 _Surfaces_

For example 3 functions, which can draw transparent rectangles, circles and polygons:

```py
def draw_rect_alpha(surface, color, rect):
    shape_surf = pygame.Surface(pygame.Rect(rect).size, pygame.SRCALPHA)
    pygame.draw.rect(shape_surf, color, shape_surf.get_rect())
    surface.blit(shape_surf, rect)
```

```py
def draw_circle_alpha(surface, color, center, radius):
    target_rect = pygame.Rect(center, (0, 0)).inflate((radius * 2, radius * 2))
    shape_surf = pygame.Surface(target_rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)
    pygame.draw.circle(shape_surf, color, (radius, radius), radius)
    surface.blit(shape_surf, target_rect)
```

```py
def draw_polygon_alpha(surface, color, points):
    lx, ly = zip(*points)
    min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y = min(lx), min(ly), max(lx), max(ly)
    target_rect = pygame.Rect(min_x, min_y, max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y)
    shape_surf = pygame.Surface(target_rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)
    pygame.draw.polygon(shape_surf, color, [(x - min_x, y - min_y) for x, y in points])
    surface.blit(shape_surf, target_rect)
```

## Draw single Pixle

Related Stack Overflow questions:

- [Pygame: Draw single pixel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10354638/pygame-draw-single-pixel/64571453#64571453)

The usual method of drawing a point on a _Surface_ or the display is to use  [`pygame.Surface.set_at']:

```py
window_surface.set_at((x, y), my_color)
```

However, this function is very slow and leads to a massive lack of performance if more than 1 point is to be drawn.

![Pygame: Draw single pixel](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OiqGY.png)

Another option is to use a ["pygame.PixelArray"](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/pixelarray.html) object. This object enables direct pixel access to _Surface_ objects. A _PixelArray_ pixel item can be assigned directly. The pixel can be accessed by subscription. The PixelArray locks the _Surface_, You have to [`close()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/pixelarray.html#pygame.PixelArray.close) it when you have changed the pixel:

```py
pixel_array = pygame.PixelArray(window_surface)

pixel_array[x, y] = my_color
pixel_array[start_x:end_x, start_y:end_y] = my_color

pixel_array.close()
```

  ![scene](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pDdn2.png)

The 3rd argument of [`pygame.draw.rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.rect) has to be a tuple with 4 elements:

<s>`pygame.draw.rect(win, (255, 0, 0),(x, y, width, height, vel))`</s>

```py
pygame.draw.rect(win, (255, 0, 0),(x, y, width, height))
```  

Alternatively it can be a [`pygame.Rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) object, too:

```py
rect = pygame.Rect(x, y, width, height)
pygame.draw.rect(win, (255, 0, 0), rect)
```

You can achieve what you want by setting the key word argument `border_radius` of the function [`pygame.draw.rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.rect).

Create a rectangle the same size as the image and and per pixel alpha (`SRCALPHA`) and draw a completely white, opaque image with round corners on it:

```py
size = self.original_image.get_size()
self.rect_image = pg.Surface(size, pg.SRCALPHA)
pg.draw.rect(self.rect_image, (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, *size), border_radius=roundness)
```

Copy the original image and use the `BLEND_RGBA_MIN` blending mode to blend the rectangle with the image (see [`pygame.Surface.blit`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.blit)):

```py
self.image = self.original_image.copy().convert_alpha()
self.image.blit(self.rect_image, (0, 0), None, pg.BLEND_RGBA_MIN)
```

**Note, the keyword attribute `border_radius` is a new feature. You have to use the most recent pygame version (2.0.0.dev10).**

If you can't use version 2.0.0.dev10, you'll need to stick the rounded rectangle together yourself:

```py
class Rectangle(pg.sprite.Sprite):
    # [...]

    def set_rounded(self, roundness):
        size = self.original_image.get_size()
        self.rect_image = pg.Surface(size, pg.SRCALPHA)

        #pg.draw.rect(self.rect_image, (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, *size), border_radius=roundness)

        r, c = roundness, (255, 255, 255)
        pg.draw.rect(self.rect_image, c, (r, 0, size[0]-2*r, size[1]))
        pg.draw.rect(self.rect_image, c, (0, r, size[0], size[1]-2*r))
        for cpt in [(r, r), (size[0]-r, r), (r, size[1]-r), (size[0]-r, size[1]-r)]:  
            pg.draw.circle(self.rect_image, c, cpt, r)

        self.image = self.original_image.copy().convert_alpha()
        self.image.blit(self.rect_image, (0, 0), None, pg.BLEND_RGBA_MIN) 
```
