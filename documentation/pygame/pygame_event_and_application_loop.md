The typical PyGame application loop has to:

- handle the events by either [`pygame.event.pump()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.pump) or [`pygame.event.get()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.get).
- update the game states and positions of objects dependent on the input events and time (respectively frames)
- clear the entire display or draw the background
- draw the entire scene (`blit` all the objects)
- update the display by either [`pygame.display.update()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.update) or [`pygame.display.flip()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.flip)

### Recursiveness

Related Stack Overflow questions:

- [Reset and restart pygame program doesn't work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64715107/reset-and-restart-pygame-program-doesnt-work/64715310#64715310)

You've overcomplicated the system. What you are actually doing is recursively instantiating a new `Gui` object and new application loop into an existing `Gui` object and application loop.
If `GameState` is implemented correctly, it should be sufficient to create a new `GameState` object and continue the existing application loop instead of recursively creating a new `Gui` instance:

```py
import board as b

class Gui():
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.init()

        self.gamestate = b.GameState()

    def run(self):

        running = True
        while running:

            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    running = False
                    pygame.quit()

                if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                    if event.key == pygame.K_r:
                        self.gamestate = b.GameState()

            # [...]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    Gui().run()
```

The instruction `self.board = s.start_position` doesn't create a new board object. `self.board` and `s.start_position` refer to the same object. If you change one of the objects, the other object seems to change in the same way since there is only one object.  
Either you need to make a deep copy of the board object when you start the game or you need to reset the object when the game restarts.

A solution might be to use the Python [`copy`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) module. `deepcopy` can create a deep copy of an object: 

```py
import copy
```

```py
self.board = copy.deepcopy(s.start_position)`
```

Note, not all object can be _deep_ copied. For instance a [`pygame.Surface`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html) cannot be _deep_ copied.

You have to handle the events in the application loop. See [`pygame.event.get()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.get) respectively [`pygame.event.pump()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.pump):

> For each frame of your game, you will need to make some sort of call to the event queue. This ensures your program can internally interact with the rest of the operating system.

#### Input in application loop

### Multiple event loops

- **[Faster version of pygame.event.get()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58086113/faster-version-of-pygame-event-get/58087070#58087070)**

[`pygame.event.get()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.get) get all the messages and remove them from the queue. If `pygame.event.get ()` is called in multiple event loops, only one loop receives the events, but never all loops receive all events. As a result, some events appear to be missed.

Get the events once and use them in multiple loops or pass the list or events to functions and methods where they are handled:

```py
def handle_events(events):
    for event in events:
        # [...]

while run:

    event_list = pygame.event.get()

    # [...]

    # 1st event loop
    for event in event_list:
        # [...]

    # [...]

    # 2nd event loop
    for event in event_list:
        # [...]

    # [...]

    # function which handles events
    handle_events(event_list)
```

### Wait for event

Related Stack Overflow questions:

- [Pygame sprite is too slow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59597330/pygame-sprite-is-too-slow/59598060#59598060)

[`pygame.event.wait()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.wait) waits for a single event from the queue. If the queue is empty this function will wait until one is created. That makes your game lag.

### Polymorphic event loop

Related Stack Overflow questions:

- [Pygame: how to write event-loop polymorphically](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60406647/pygame-how-to-write-event-loop-polymorphically/60408967#60408967)

In pygame the event type is an enumerator constant. You have to map this constant to the corresponding class. Use a [`dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries):

```py
def Exit(event):
    # [...]

def Keydown():
    # [...]

eventhandler = {pygame.QUIT: Exit, pygame.KEYDOWN: Keydown}
```

For a more general approach, the handlers can be managed in a list. So multiple actions can be associated to an event type

```py
def Exit(event):
    # [...]

def Keydown1():
    # [...]

def Keydown2():
    # [...]

eventhandler = {pygame.QUIT: [Exit], pygame.KEYDOWN: [Keydown1, Keydown2]}
```

The events must be delegated to the appropriate actions assigned in the event handler:

```py
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type in eventhandler:
            for target in eventhandler[event.type]:
                target(event)
```
