## Questions

### Move and stay in window

Add question: How do i keep my player in the window.

Answer: 1. use `clmap_ip`; 2. Use modulo (%) operator

### How to create rectangle centered around a point

Why is there no `pygame.Rect(0, 0, w, t).get_rect(center = (x, y))`

`rect = pygame.Rect(x, y, 0, 0).inflate(x, h)`

Combine Gray scale image color multiplier and bit mask.

## New projects

### Random enemies

1. Spawn enemies (represented by a red dot) at random locations one after the other at certain intervals The enemies should not intersect and keep a minimum distance to each other.

1. Implement a swarm movement.

### Pong

Sophisticated circle and rectangle intersection

[Sometimes the ball doesn't bounce off the paddle in pong game](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62864205/sometimes-the-ball-doesnt-bounce-off-the-paddle-in-pong-game)

(update question title)

Compute relative movement of sphere and rectangle. Find intersection on the way.

### PyGame object library

Shapes class like circle, ellipse, triangle, polygon etc. based on `pygame.Rectangle`. _Sprite_ class (`SpriteShape`) which can represent a shape class. Operator which can compute the intersections of the shapes.

### Platform game

Intersect with lines instead of rectangles. Optionally lines can have an intersecting and a non intersecting side (normal vector). The intersection with blocks can be determined by the intersection with 1, 3 or 4 lines, where the intersection just works if the object comes from the "outside" the block and not from "inside" the block.
